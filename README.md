## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd remote-bos
   ```

2. **Open in browser**:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   # or

   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   node script.test.js
   ```

### Production Deployment

1. **Configure Google Analytics**:
   - Replace `GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` in `index.html` and `thank-you.html` with your actual Google Analytics tracking ID

2. **Set up backend** (choose one):
   - Google Sheets (recommended for quick start)
   - Firebase (recommended for production)
   - Custom API

   See [`backend-setup.md`](backend-setup.md) for detailed instructions.

3. **Deploy to hosting platform**:
   - **Netlify**: Drag and drop the project folder
   - **Vercel**: Connect GitHub repo and deploy
   - **GitHub Pages**: Enable in repository settings
   - **AWS S3**: Upload files and enable static hosting

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite covering:
- Email validation (7 tests)
- First name validation (10 tests)
- Last name validation (10 tests)
- Edge cases and negative tests (6 tests)

**Run tests**:
```bash
node script.test.js
```

**Expected output**:
```
Tests Passed: 33
Tests Failed: 0
Total Tests: 33
```

## 📊 Analytics & Tracking

The landing page tracks the following events:
- **Page views**: Automatic tracking of all page visits
- **CTA clicks**: "Join the Waitlist" button clicks
- **Form submissions**: Successful waitlist sign-ups
- **Conversions**: Thank you page views

## 🎨 Customization

### Update Content
Edit `index.html` to modify:
- Headline and subheadline
- Problem statements
- Feature descriptions
- Contact information

### Update Styles
Edit `style.css` to customize:
- Color scheme (currently purple gradient)
- Typography
- Layout and spacing
- Responsive breakpoints

### Update Validation Rules
Edit `script.js` to modify:
- Field validation patterns
- Error messages
- Form submission behavior

## 🔧 Backend Integration

The form currently uses a **simulated backend** that logs submissions to the console. To enable real data collection:

1. Review the options in [`backend-setup.md`](backend-setup.md)
2. Choose your preferred backend (Google Sheets, Firebase, or custom API)
3. Follow the setup instructions
4. Update the `submitToBackend()` function in `script.js`

## 📈 Success Metrics

**Primary Metric**:
- 100-150 email sign-ups within 30 days

**Secondary Metrics**:
- Sign-up conversion rate
- Form completion rate
- Traffic sources (LinkedIn, organic, referrals)
- Time on page
- Bounce rate

**Decision Criteria**:
If the sign-up goal is met, proceed with MVP development. If not, analyze the data and iterate on:
- Landing page copy
- Visual design
- Value proposition
- Traffic acquisition strategy

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Modern responsive styles (inspired by Tailwind CSS)
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies
- **Google Analytics**: Event tracking and analytics
- **Backend Options**: Google Sheets, Firebase, or custom API

## 📝 Development Workflow

This project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD):
1. Write failing tests for new functionality
2. Implement code to pass tests
3. Refactor and clean up
4. Repeat

See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for detailed development log.
