Execute the following development cycle to implement and evaluate the latest recommendation.

## Core Tasks
1. **Checkpoint**: Save current state before changes
   ```bash
   git add . && git commit -m "Checkpoint: Pre-landing page implementation"
   ```
2. **Status Update**: Document concisely the current progress in `CLAUDE.md`
   - Include timestamp and brief description of changes being made.

3. **Implementation**: Build the landing page as specified in the analysis.
   - **Project Setup**:
     - Initialize a new project directory.
     - Choose and integrate a responsive framework (Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS).
     - Create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
   - **UI Development (Static Content)**:
     - Implement the Header with logo and navigation (Home, Features, Contact).
     - Build the Hero Section with the headline, subheadline, a placeholder for the dashboard visual, and a "Join the Waitlist" button.
     - Create the Problem Section highlighting pain points for freelancers.
     - Develop the Solution/Features Section detailing the AI Assistant, SMS Management, and Voicemail Transcripts.
     - Add the Value Proposition Section with key benefits.
     - Implement the Footer with contact info and legal links.
   - **Backend and Form Integration**:
     - Build the Call to Action Section with an HTML form to capture First Name, Last Name, and Email.
     - Write JavaScript for client-side form validation.
     - Set up a backend service (Firebase or Google Sheets) to store form submissions.
     - Ensure the form submission redirects to a simple "Thank You" page.
   - **Analytics and SEO**:
     - Integrate Google Analytics to track page views, CTA clicks, and sign-up events.
     - Add meta tags to `index.html` with the specified SEO keywords ("AI virtual assistant for business," "business SMS solution," "voicemail transcription service").

4. **Testing**: Verify implementation works correctly.
   - Test the landing page on multiple screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Confirm that the "Join the Waitlist" form successfully captures user data in the backend.
   - Validate all navigation and CTA links.

5. **Test-Driven/Behavior-Driven Development (TDD/BDD)**:
   - **Write a Failing Test**: Create a test for the email form validation (e.g., ensures an invalid email shows an error).
   - **Write Code to Pass the Test**: Implement the JavaScript validation logic.
   - **Refactor**: Clean up the validation script.
   - **Incorporate Negative Tests**: Add tests to handle empty fields or incorrect data types.
   - **Incrementally Build**: Repeat for other interactive elements if any.

6. **Code Quality Audit**: As a software architect, ensure:
   - Code quality and maintainability.
   - Clear, useful comments, especially for the form handling logic.
   - Remove redundancies and dead code.
   - Clean up temporary files.

7. **Results Analysis**: Based on the validation campaign, determine:
   - **Primary Metric**: Track the number of sign-ups against the goal (100â€“150 in 30 days).
   - **Secondary Metrics**: Analyze sign-up rate, form completion rate, and traffic sources (e.g., LinkedIn vs. organic).
   - **Decision**: Determine if market interest is sufficient to proceed with MVP development.

8. **Iterate**: If sign-up goals are not met, repeat from step 2.
   - Document what didn't work (e.g., low traffic, low conversion).
   - Adjust the landing page copy, visuals, or ad campaign based on learnings.

9. **Documentation Update**:
   - Update `CLAUDE.md` with a concise summary of the validation results.
   - Update `README.md` to reflect the project's status post-validation.

10. **Final Checkpoint**: Commit completed work.
    ```bash
    git add . && git commit -m "Feat: Implement and deploy landing page for market validation"
    ```
